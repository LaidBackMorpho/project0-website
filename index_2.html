        <h1> What Programming Means to Me  </h1>
        <p>
          To me, programming is more than just typing text on a screen and
          hoping it will work flawlessly each time it runs. Don't get me wrong,
          it's great when that does happen, but development is so much more.
          It's a beautiful process of problem-solving, learning about the
          particular issue trying to be dealt with and how to rectify all the
          nuances that come with it. By the time a program is finished, the
          person or team behind it will understand nearly all
          of the facets that the issue has to offer. After all, a successful
          program is a problem solved, no matter the size or impact.
        </p>

        <h2>The Programming Languages I Know </h2>

        <p>
          So far, the programming languages I've learned are Lua and Python.
          About six years ago I started learning Lua. I taught myself by
          looking at the source code of what others had created.  Five years,
          two hiatuses, and one decision about what I want to do with my life
          later, I learned Python in college.
        </p>

        <h3> Notable Programs I've Made  </h3>

        <p>
            <ul>
              <li> A Python program that converts a .chart file into a Lua module
              (this module contains values like the length of one bar in seconds, the colors
              of the notes, the distance between notes, and the length of sustain
              notes).
              </li>
              <li> A trapezoidal rule calculator (as a really cool extra-credit
                assignment for a programming class). </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
