Web Programming with Python and JavaScript


My project is a website about me and my interests, programming and music.

In index.html, you will find the HTML code for my homepage.
In index_1.html, you will find the HTML code for my about page, 
index_2.html for programming page HTML code, and 
index_3.html for music page HTML code.

Inside of both stlyes.css and styles.scss, you will find the stylings I used for this webiste.
Other than bootstrap, stlyes.css is the only CSS file that this site uses, 
which is (as you probably already knew) converted from stlyes.scss.
